<p>
    I am going to create a website that produces and sell games.
    This website is based on Activision a gaming company.
    The first page is gonna be a home page, its going to feature navigation bars at the top and images and info of the games produced.
    The second page is going to be a contact us page with a form.
    The third page will be a sign up page.
    The other buttons will be linked to activision page.

    javascript doesnt seem to be working so i commented it out, i was trying to use it to validate password on the signup.html
